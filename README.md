# Microchallenge-3

Designed and made as part of the third challenge in the IAAC Master in Design for Emergent Futures course "Digital Prototyping for Design", this project is an exploration of the aesthetic and practical possibilities of reusing greywater in an urban environment.

Team: CAGSUN, KORBINIAN, RAMIRO as FLOWING FUTURES COLLECTIVE

This week we decided to make some improves on the greywater recuperation system and challenged ourselves to design and build an hybrid concept by combining automated manual mechanisms. So we have a live comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of each one while water flows through the stages of filtering of the system, cleaning the greywater returning it back to the system for a new usage. We have already started making changes the week before the challenge, by changing some materials and designing some connections to assembly the hole system together. 

The full work on this challenge was almost physical on the prototype, with some electronics and coding work in the computer.

THINGS DONE:

- new wheels
- layers filter improved, all the stages can be separated for manteinance and for showing how the process works (transparence and open-box values)
- new connections in the buckets for moving water between the modules
- changed way we move water in the system, by creating the "hybrid" concept and making one manual pedal pump for taking clean water to the sink.
- the other automated pump takes water from the lipid trap to the plants and mineral filters (old-wasted 3d printed clay found at IAAC, sand, activated carbon)
- this automated pump was activated when a simple (low-tech) sensor touched water when it level rised in the lipid trap, so it will never be full and the user doesnt intervenes in the process and doesnt need to be alert at the level.

We are in process of creating a big documentation for making this BIO-WATER FILTER accessible to anyone looking forward to build it, with all the building process  explained step by step with photos and videos.
